<!-- Create a tree function that should build a pine tree out of a character in the browser console. It accepts a single object as an argument. The object should have two key/value pairs.

A key that specifies the height of the pine tree.
The value for the height of the tree should be from user input in a <input type="text"> field in the DOM.
A key that specifies which character to use to build the pine tree.
The character to use should be from user input in a <input type="text"> field in the DOM.
Once the user enters in a number, and a character, the user can either then just press the enter key (as long as the cursor is in one of the input fields), or click a button that is labeled "Grow your tree" and the tree should be shown in the console.

If either of the input fields does not have a value in it when the user presses the enter key, or presses the button, then display an alert stating that both fields must have a value.

Grow your tree

Example

Here's what the pine tree should look like when you specify a height of 7, and use the asterisk character.

     ***
    *****
   *******
